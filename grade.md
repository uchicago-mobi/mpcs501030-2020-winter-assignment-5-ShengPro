Nice work with functionality üëçüèª

Your code architecture is well thought out. Helper methods to delegate indivudual tasks, e.g. `func zoomPlace(place: Place)` and `func updateInfoView(place: Place)`. Well-named properties and methods, so that when I read them, I immediately know what their purpose is. Keep it up.

You could be more concise with this snippet:
```
if favPlaces.contains(selectedPlace.name!) {
  favoriteButton.isSelected = true
} else {
  favoriteButton.isSelected = false
}
```

We don't _need_ the Bool literals here. Instead, we can just write:
```
favoriteButton.isSelected = favPlaces.contains(selectedPlace.name!)
```
